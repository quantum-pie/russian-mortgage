function [ mtp ] = total_duration( mp, p, ipp, tp, ops, cdf, pr )
% Function to calculate chained mortgage total duration in months (mtp). 
% Chained procedure consists of (ops) operations and goes as follows:
% - first operation with price (pr(1)) is carried out with (ipp) initial
% payment.
% - now you sell first flat for (pr(1)) price and use this money as initial
% payment for second operation that costs (pr(2)) and so on.
% - last operation costs target price (tp).
% We assume that target price and initial payment for first operation (ipp)
% are constant and other (ops - 1) prices are variables that used to 
% minimize total payment duration.
% Other arguments are:
% mp - montly annuity payment in rubles 
% p - annual interest rate in percents
% cdf - name of function to calculate duration of one operation
